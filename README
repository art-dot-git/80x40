I who have never had a trade                                                    
who have felt weak facing every competitor                                      
who lost the best titles for life                                               
who barely arrive somewhere and already want to leave                           
          (believing that moving is a solution)                                 
who have been denied in anticipation and ridiculed by                           
          the most able                                                         
who lean against the walls so I won’t completely collapse                       
who am a target of laughter even for myself                                     
who thought my father was eternal                                               
who have been humiliated by professors of literature                            
who one day asked how I could help and the answer was a                         
          loud laugh                                                            
who will never be able to start a home, nor be brilliant, nor                   
          triumph in life                                                       
who have been abandoned by many people because I barely                         
          speak                                                                 
who am ashamed of acts I haven’t committed                                      
who have needed little incentive to start running down                          
          the street                                                            
who have lost a center I never had                                              
who have become the laughing stock of so many people for                        
          living in limbo                                                       
who never found anyone who would put up with me                                 
who was omitted in favor of people more miserable than me                       
who will spend my whole life like this and who next year                        
          will be mocked many more times for my ridiculous                      
          ambition                                                              
who am tired of receiving advice from others more lethargic                     
          than me (“You’re so slow, get with it, wake up”)                      
who will never be able to travel to India                                       
who have received favors without giving anything in return                      
who traverse the city from one end to another like a feather                    
who let myself be pulled along by others                                        
who have no personality and don’t want to have one                              
who muffle my rebellion all day                                                 
who haven't joined the guerrillas                                               
who haven’t done anything for my people                                         
who don’t belong to the FALN and all these things and others                    
          whose enumeration would be interminable make me
